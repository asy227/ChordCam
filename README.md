# ChordCam
ChordCam is an interactive desktop app that uses your computer’s webcam to detect hand positions and map them to ukulele chords. It uses MediaPipe Hands for real-time hand landmark detection and can play back audio recordings of defined chords.

✨ Features:

🖐️ Detects your hand and recognizes custom chord gestures

🎸 Plays chord audio when a gesture is recognized (you can upload your own recordings!)

🔄 Inverted camera view for easier playing orientation

🎯 Extensible — add more chords and custom finger positions without rewriting core logic

🤖 AI-ready — train a gesture classification model (scikit-learn or TensorFlow) to recognize more natural ukulele chords

Right now, the following ukulele chords are mapped to simple “finger up” patterns:

C → Index up

G → Index + Middle up

Am → Index + Middle + Ring up

F → Index + Middle + Ring + Pinky up
